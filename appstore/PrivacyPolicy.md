Your data never leaves your device. We do not:
- Upload data to servers

- Use analytics or tracking services

## Third-Party Services

The App uses:

## Children's Privacy

Momentus does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The app is rated 4+ and suitable for all ages, but we recommend parental guidance for younger users due to the philosophical themes around mortality.
